Pre-execution audit gate. Runs before EXECUTE. Verdict is decisive.

## Step 1 -- Locate the plan

Check in order: user-specified path, `.ijfw/memory/plan.md`, `.planning/**/PLAN.md`.
If none found: `No plan doc located. Paste the plan or give the path.` Do not proceed.

## Step 2 -- Goal-backward analysis

Read success criteria from `.ijfw/memory/brief.md` if present. For every task: does
it trace to a criterion? Tasks with no traceable criterion are scope drift -- flag them.

## Step 3 -- Scope leak check

Anything in the plan not in the brief is a scope leak. List each with task name + reason.
If no brief exists, flag the absence as a risk.

## Step 4 -- Risk surface

Flag tasks that are under-specified (no verify step, no file path), half-baked
(depends on an undecided decision), or destructive (no rollback note).

## Step 5 -- Dependency ordering

If task B needs task A's output but B is listed before A, flag the inversion with names.

## Step 6 -- Verdict

```
Plan audit: <N> tasks reviewed
Goal alignment:   <N> trace to criteria / <N> need attention
Scope:            clean | <N> leak(s)
Risk surface:     <N> need sharpening
Dependency order: correct | <N> inversion(s)

Verdict: PASS | FLAG | BLOCK

Must-fix before execution (FLAG):
  1. <task> -- <file>:<line> -- <fix>

Rework needed (BLOCK):
  1. <issue> -- <reason>
```

- **PASS**: proceed to EXECUTE.
- **FLAG**: fix numbered items, then proceed.
- **BLOCK**: rework required. Do not execute until re-audited.

Closer: `You have a <PASS|FLAG|BLOCK> -- <next action>.`
