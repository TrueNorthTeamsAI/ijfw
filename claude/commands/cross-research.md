allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Bash", "Grep"]
---

Deep-research triangulation from multiple agents. Solves "a single model's training
data is a single lens." Parallel fan-out collects independent claim sets, then a
synthesis pass merges them into a consensus/contested/unique matrix with open
questions surfaced. All three requests, responses, and the merged output archive
automatically.

## Subcommands

| Form | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `/cross-research`                     | **Zero-arg auto-pick.** Detect target from git state (staged → unstaged → last commit). Pick default roster (Codex=benchmarks, Gemini=citations). Generate Phase A requests. |
| `/cross-research <target>`            | Same auto-pick, named target. |
| `/cross-research --with <id> [target]` | Override an auditor slot: `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `aider`, `copilot`. Target optional. |
| `/cross-research list`                | Show roster with self marker. No requests generated. |
| `/cross-research compare`             | Read Phase A responses, build Phase B synthesis request, fire it, render matrix, archive. |

## Smart target auto-detection (bare `/cross-research`)

When invoked without a target, run this detection cascade and use the first
non-empty result:

1. **Staged changes** -- `git diff --cached --name-only`
2. **Unstaged changes** -- `git diff --name-only`
3. **Last commit** -- `git diff HEAD~1 --name-only`
4. If all empty: print the roster and ask "what topic would you like researched?"

Report which step succeeded:

```
Cross-research target auto-detected: 2 staged file(s)
  mcp-server/src/cross-dispatcher.js
  mcp-server/test-cross-dispatcher.js
(Override with /cross-research <path> or /cross-research --with <id> <path>.)
```

If >5 files, group in request body but list all paths. If a single file >2000 lines,
use the diff hunks rather than the full file.

The natural-language phrase **"research this across models"** / **"multi-model
research"** fires the intent router (`mcp-server/src/intent-router.js`), which
nudges Claude to invoke `/cross-research` automatically -- same auto-detect flow runs.

## Default flow -- Donahoe Trident (don't make me think)

Caller is one perspective. **Default is two independent research streams feeding
one synthesis.** The Trident yields: independent evidence collection in parallel,
then a single merge pass that exposes what each model knew, what they agreed on,
and where they diverge.

When invoked, do this in order:

1. **Probe roster.** Call `pickAuditors({ count: 2, env: process.env })` from
   `audit-roster.js`. Returns `{ picks, missing, note }` -- picks are installed
   AND non-self.

2. **Show a TODO surface** in chat:

   ```
   Cross-research plan
     [ ] Step A.1: Generate Wave A requests (codex=benchmarks, gemini=citations)
     [ ] Step A.2: Fire codex in background
     [ ] Step A.2: Fire gemini in background
     [ ] Wait for both completions
     [ ] Step B.1: Generate Wave B synthesis request (claude=synthesis)
     [ ] Step B.2: Fire synthesis
     [ ] Step B.3: Render consensus/contested/unique matrix
     [ ] Step B.4: Archive all requests + responses + merge
   ```

3. **Ask the user once** which combo to run:

   ```
   Auditors detected and ready: codex, gemini.
   Run cross-research:
     [A] codex only (benchmarks angle)
     [B] gemini only (citations angle)
     [C] Both -- recommended (Donahoe Trident, enables full synthesis)
     [D] Cancel / pick custom
   ```

   Default suggestion: **C (Both)** when >=2 installed. Synthesis (Phase B) requires
   both Phase A responses; if only one auditor runs, Phase B renders a partial
   synthesis and flags the gap.

4. **If only one installed:**

   > "Only `<id>` is installed locally. The full Trident shines here -- two
   > independent research streams remove single-model blind spots before synthesis.
   > Install one of the available auditors (opencode, aider, etc.) to unlock the
   > complete picture."

   Then offer to run the single-auditor partial flow.

5. **Fire Wave A in background** (see Wave A section below).

6. **After Wave A completes**, run `/cross-research compare` (or fire it
   automatically when both background jobs notify).

7. **Fire Wave B synthesis** via fresh Claude session (see Wave B section below).

8. **Render matrix** from `mergeResponses('research', responses)`.

9. **Archive** all files to `.ijfw/cross-audit/archive/<ts>-research/`.

## Auditor picking

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "import('./mcp-server/src/audit-roster.js').then(m => console.log(m.formatRoster()))"
```

Default pick order (first non-self): `codex → gemini → opencode → aider → copilot → claude`.

Research role assignment is mode-aware via `assignRoles('research', roster, self)` in
`cross-dispatcher.js`:
- `codex` → `benchmarks` angle
- `gemini` → `citations` angle
- Synthesis always goes to a **fresh Claude session via `claude -p`** -- never the
  caller's own session, even if self=claude, to prevent circularity.

---

## Wave A -- Parallel fan-out

### Step A.1 -- Generate Phase A requests via the dispatcher

Run one node call per auditor:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import('./mcp-server/src/cross-dispatcher.js').then(m =>
  process.stdout.write(m.buildRequest('research', '<target>', 'codex', 'benchmarks'))
)" > .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-codex.md
```

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import('./mcp-server/src/cross-dispatcher.js').then(m =>
  process.stdout.write(m.buildRequest('research', '<target>', 'gemini', 'citations'))
)" > .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-gemini.md
```

> **Note:** `buildRequest` is synchronous and returns a string -- do NOT `.then()` it. Wrap it in `process.stdout.write(...)` directly.

Replace `<target>` with the detected or specified target string.

### Step A.2 -- Fire auditors in background

**Auto-fire is required.** Do NOT stop at "request written -- paste it into Codex."
Only fall back to human paste when `command -v <auditor>` fails AND the roster
probe returns the auditor as missing.

Fire each in background via Bash tool with `run_in_background:true`:

```bash
cat .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-codex.md | codex exec - > .ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-codex.md
```

```bash
cat .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-gemini.md | gemini - > .ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-gemini.md
```

Both run simultaneously. Wait for both completion notifications before proceeding
to Phase B. Update the TODO surface to `in_progress` then `completed` per auditor.

### Step A.2b -- Fire Claude specialist swarm in parallel (caller leg)

**Caller-side = specialist swarm, not single opinion.** The Trident's third leg
is a parallel dispatch of in-session subagents -- research specialists chosen for
the target's domain. This fires ALONGSIDE Codex + Gemini, not after.

Fire these via the `Agent` tool in the same message (all independent, same
target) so they run concurrently with the external auditors:

| Specialist | Dispatched via | Angle |
|------------|---------------|-------|
| Codebase exploration specialist | `Agent` tool | mapping existing implementation precedents |
| Architecture specialist | `Agent` tool | patterns and design precedents |
| Code reviewer specialist | `Agent` tool | convention/correctness from the repo's own rules |
| Silent-failure hunter specialist | `Agent` tool | reliability precedents from current code |

Pick the subset relevant to the research target. Each returns structured
findings; merge them into ONE composite JSON array matching the research
schema `{claim, evidence, source, confidence}`, write to:

```
.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-caller.md
```

This file joins `response-research-codex.md` and `response-research-gemini.md`
as the three Phase A inputs to Phase B synthesis.

**Missing auditor fallback (positive framing only):**
If `command -v codex` (or `gemini`) fails, surface:

> "Codex isn't installed locally -- paste `request-research-codex.md` into
> https://platform.openai.com/playground and save the response as
> `.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-codex.md`, then re-run
> `/cross-research compare`."

---

## Wave B -- Synthesis (sequential, after Wave A)

### Step B.1 -- Generate the synthesis request

Read both Phase A responses and feed them as `priorResponses` to the dispatcher:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import('./mcp-server/src/cross-dispatcher.js').then(async m => {
  const fs = await import('fs');
  const codex = fs.readFileSync('.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-codex.md','utf8');
  const gemini = fs.readFileSync('.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-gemini.md','utf8');
  // Caller-swarm file is optional -- if absent, synthesis runs on the two
  // external sources. If present, it's the third leg of the Trident.
  let caller = '';
  try { caller = fs.readFileSync('.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-caller.md','utf8'); } catch {}
  // Pass a labeled string, not an unlabeled array -- the dispatcher interpolates
  // priorResponses verbatim, so labels preserve per-source provenance in synthesis.
  const labeled = '### Codex (benchmarks)\n\n' + codex +
    '\n\n### Gemini (citations)\n\n' + gemini +
    (caller ? '\n\n### Caller swarm (observations)\n\n' + caller : '');
  process.stdout.write(m.buildRequest('research', '<target>', 'claude', 'synthesis', labeled));
})" > .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-synthesis.md
```

### Step B.2 -- Fire synthesis via fresh Claude session

**Auto-fire is required.** Fire via Bash tool with `run_in_background:true`:

```bash
cat .ijfw/cross-audit/request-research-synthesis.md | claude -p > .ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-synthesis.md
```

A fresh `claude -p` session is used even when the caller is Claude, to prevent
the synthesis from being colored by the caller's in-session context.

### Step B.3 -- Render matrix

Once the synthesis response lands, call `mergeResponses` to build the final matrix:

```bash
node --input-type=module -e "
import('./mcp-server/src/cross-dispatcher.js').then(async m => {
  const fs = await import('fs');
  // mergeResponses expects parsed { items } objects, not raw strings.
  // Route each response through parseResponse first.
  const ids = ['codex','gemini','caller','synthesis'].filter(id => {
    try { fs.readFileSync(\`.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-\${id}.md\`); return true; }
    catch { return false; }
  });
  const parsed = ids.map(id => {
    const raw = fs.readFileSync(\`.ijfw/cross-audit/response-research-\${id}.md\`,'utf8');
    return m.parseResponse('research', raw);
  });
  const merged = m.mergeResponses('research', parsed);
  process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify(merged, null, 2));
})"
```

Render the merged result as:

```
## Research matrix -- <target>

### Consensus (>=2 sources agree)
| Claim | Evidence | Sources | Confidence |
|-------|----------|---------|------------|
| ...   | ...      | ...     | high       |

### Contested (sources disagree)
| Claim | Codex says | Gemini says | Delta |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-------|

### Unique (single-source, investigate)
| Claim | Source | Flag |
|-------|--------|------|

### Open questions
- ...
```

### Step B.4 -- Archive

Move all six files (3 requests + 3 responses) plus the merged JSON to:

```
.ijfw/cross-audit/archive/<YYYY-MM-DDTHHMM>-research/
  request-research-codex.md
  request-research-gemini.md
  request-research-synthesis.md
  response-research-codex.md
  response-research-gemini.md
  response-research-synthesis.md
  merge.json
```

## Notes

- Wave A is always parallel; Wave B is always sequential (depends on Wave A).
- The synthesis angle always runs in a fresh `claude -p` session -- never the caller's
  own context.
- `audit-roster.js` detection is conservative: if the caller cannot be identified,
  all options are shown rather than guessing.
- Positive framing throughout: no "missing auditor error" -- "install to unlock the
  full Trident."
