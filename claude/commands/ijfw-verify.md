description: "Run the IJFW workflow Verify phase (Deep D5). Full audit against the original brief. Usage: /ijfw-verify"
---

**Plausibility is not correctness.** Run the full Verify phase of the IJFW workflow. This is the quality gate before shipping -- a structured audit of everything built against the original brief. Every claim must trace to a command output, a test pass, or a manual verification you actually performed; never report "done" based on a plausible-looking diff alone.

**What runs:**

- Functional checks: all tests pass, startup verified, offline behavior tested
- Behavior diff against `main`: when relevant, run the same scenario on `main` and on the working tree, compare outputs side by side. Catches silent regressions that pass tests but change observable behavior. Skip for purely additive changes (new files, new endpoints) where there is no `main` baseline to diff against.
- UX audit: first impression, no "feel stupid" moments, every error has a recovery path
- Security and quality: auth on every endpoint, parameterised queries, no leaked secrets,
  accessibility, linter clean
- Brief alignment: every success criterion from Discovery is checked explicitly

**Multi-AI Quality Trident (Donahoe P9):** For critical work, Verify also prepares
a cross-audit document summarizing what was built and key risk areas, ready for
review in Gemini, Codex, or another AI session. Use `/cross-audit` to generate it
explicitly.

This command invokes `ijfw-workflow` at the D5 Verify phase directly. IJFW owns
the audit loop end-to-end.

**Natural triggers:** "verify the work", "run the audit", "check everything",
"quality gate", "are we ready to ship?"

If gaps are found, Verify stays open until they're resolved -- it does not
auto-advance to Ship on a partial pass.

**GATE:** Verify phase ends at the SHIP GATE -- original brief re-read, what was
built matches what was asked. All items pass before advancing to Ship.
