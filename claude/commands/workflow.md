Start or continue the IJFW project workflow.

**/workflow** (no args) -- Detect current stage and resume.
**/workflow discover** -- Start a new project from Discovery.
**/workflow plan** -- Jump to planning (if brief exists).
**/workflow execute** -- Start or resume execution (if plan exists).
**/workflow verify** -- Run full verification audit.
**/workflow ship** -- Pre-flight checklist.
**/workflow status** -- Show current project state, stage, and progress.

The workflow runs audit gates at every stage transition.
Audit gates check against the Donahoe Principles.
See references/donahoe-principles.md for the full framework.
