# IJFW Workflow v2

Your FIRST action must be tool calls, NOT text output. Follow these steps in exact order.

## RESUME CHECK (run before Step 0)

Check if an in-progress workflow exists: `Read(".ijfw/state/workflow.json")`. If it exists and `status` is `"in_progress"`:
1. Read `.ijfw/state/workflow-context.md` for compressed state (brief, decisions, plan, team)
2. Echo state to user: "Found an in-progress workflow at [phase]. [brief summary]. Continue or restart?"
3. If continue: resume from the saved phase. If restart: proceed to Step 0.

If the file doesn't exist or status is `"complete"`, proceed to Step 0.

## STEP 0: SETUP (your very first response)

### 0A. Ensure directories exist
```bash
mkdir -p .ijfw/memory .ijfw/state .planning/brainstorm
```
Run this FIRST via `Bash` tool before any file writes.

### 0B. Detect tier
Count words in user's prompt:
- Express: < 15 words + clear verb + object
- Quick: 15-40 words, clear scope
- Deep: > 40 words OR vague verbs OR "new project"/"brainstorm"/"launch" OR no `.ijfw/memory/`

### 0C. Create TODO via TaskCreate
If `TaskCreate` is available, call it for EACH workflow step. Deep mode tasks:
- "Step 1: Clarify -- understand the project"
- "Step 2: Research -- investigate domain and codebase"
- "Step 3: Brainstorm -- shape decisions and lock brief"
- "Step 4: Build team -- assemble specialists"
- "Step 5: Plan -- execution strategy + task breakdown"
- "Step 6: Execute -- build with live progress"
- "Step 7: Verify -- tests, lint, review"
- "Step 8: Ship -- PR, merge, or deploy"

Quick: `Frame` / `Shape` / `Lock brief` / `Plan + Build` / `Verify + Ship`
Express: `Confirm brief` / `Build` / `Ship`

If `TaskCreate` is unavailable (non-Claude-Code platforms), print the TODO as a text checklist instead.

### 0D. Offer interaction style
If `AskUserQuestion` is available, use it. If not, ask as plain text with numbered options.

Detect domain from the prompt. Set the recommended default:
- **Creative domains** (book, story, novel, game, campaign, brand, music, art): default "Let's talk"
- **Technical domains** (app, landing page, API, dashboard, tool, website): default "Guided questions"

```json
{ "questions": [{ "question": "How do you want to work through this?", "header": "Style", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
  { "label": "Let's talk about it", "description": "Open conversation -- we'll riff on the idea together. I'll capture key points as we go." },
  { "label": "Guided questions", "description": "Structured A/B/C choices to zero in fast. Good for technical decisions." }
]}]}
```
Put "(Recommended)" on the domain-appropriate default with a reason.

If `ijfw_memory_recall` returns a stored interaction style preference, use it as the default instead of domain detection. On first choice, store the preference: `ijfw_memory_store({ key: "interaction_style", value: "<guided|conversation>" })`.

### 0E. Print tier + policy (AFTER tool calls)
```
Reading this as [Deep/Quick/Express] -- [reason]. Say "go deeper" or "just quick" to switch.
Second Opinions are on -- I'll check your brief, plan, and build automatically. Say "no reviews" to turn off.
```

---

## INTERACTION MODES (applies to Steps 1-3)

### Guided mode
- Use `AskUserQuestion` for every decision. One question per turn.
- Recommendations only when you have a basis (research, best practices). Fact questions (product name, what it does, asset classes) get no recommendation -- those are the user's domain.
- Use `preview` field for visual comparisons.
- Echo back understanding after every 2-3 answers.

### Conversation mode
- **No `AskUserQuestion` calls.** Just talk. Back-and-forth, riffing, exploring ideas.
- Contribute ideas, ask follow-ups conversationally, challenge assumptions, suggest "what ifs."
- **Periodic capture:** After each of YOUR responses, check: have 3+ new substantive points emerged since the last capture? If yes, capture: "Noted -- [key points]. Adding to the working doc." Write/append to `.planning/brainstorm/notes.md`. This replaces the vague "~5 turns" with a concrete trigger: new substantive points, not turn count.
- **Checkpoint on capture:** When capturing, also write a snapshot to `.ijfw/state/workflow-context.md` with current brief fields covered. This survives context compaction.
- **Research at natural points:** When a specific topic comes up that needs grounding, offer targeted research. Not an upfront swarm.
- **Readiness check:** After 3+ captures, check what brief fields are still missing. If most are covered, offer: "I think we've got a solid picture of [X, Y, Z]. Ready to capture this and move on, or keep exploring?" User controls when to move on.
- **Context safety:** If you've done 8+ captures without the user moving on, flag it: "We've covered a lot of ground. Want me to write up everything so far as a draft brief? We can always add more." This prevents context exhaustion.
- **The TODO list is always visible below.** User can say "next step" / "okay let's go" anytime.

### Adaptive switching (both directions, no announcements)
- **Guided -> Conversation:** User drops a paragraph with creative "what if" language, starts riffing. Follow naturally. Capture as points emerge. When the tangent resolves, summarize what settled and offer: "Want to keep talking, or go back to structured choices?"
- **Conversation -> Guided:** User wants a specific decision. Offer `AskUserQuestion` for that one decision, then return to conversation.
- **When switching from conversation to guided mid-brainstorm:** Read `.planning/brainstorm/notes.md` to see what's already covered. Skip modules whose topics are already captured. Tell the user: "Based on our conversation, FRAME and RECON are covered. Picking up at SHAPE."

---

## STEP 1: CLARIFY (all tiers)

**Guided mode:** `AskUserQuestion` one question at a time. See `references/think-phase.md` for examples.

**Conversation mode:** Open-ended: "Tell me about this project -- what are you building and why?"

**Both modes:** Call `ijfw_memory_recall` with goal keywords (if available -- silent no-op if MCP server isn't running). Mark "Step 1: Clarify" completed when you have enough context.

**Rewrite vague asks into verifiable goals before locking the brief:**
- "Add validation" -> "Write tests for invalid inputs (empty, malformed, oversized), then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" -> "Write a failing test that reproduces the reported symptom, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" -> "Existing test suite passes before and after. No public API changes."
- "Make it faster" -> "Benchmark the current hot path, identify the bottleneck with profiling, change it, show the benchmark improved."
- "Clean up the code" -> "Pick one specific smell. Fix only that. Diff fits in one commit message."

If the user gives a goal you can't reduce to a checkable outcome, surface that gap before proceeding rather than picking silently.

**Express:** Auto-generate 3-line brief (Goal / Approach / Done when). Print it and ask "Looks good? (yes / edit / go deeper)" as plain text -- no AskUserQuestion overhead for Express speed. On confirm: write `.ijfw/memory/brief.md`, skip Steps 2-5 (no research, no brainstorm, no team, no plan), go directly to Step 6 (Execute) with the brief as the task spec. Verify + Ship as normal.

## STEP 2: RESEARCH (mandatory for Deep, scout for Quick, skip for Express)

**Guided mode:** Dispatch agents upfront in parallel via `Agent` tool with `run_in_background: true`:
- Domain research, Technical research, Codebase scout, Design research (if UI)
- When agents return: YOU synthesize findings into 3-5 bullets and present in chat. Then write the synthesis to `.ijfw/memory/research.md`. Do NOT let agents write to research.md directly (prevents race conditions).

**Conversation mode:** Research is targeted, not upfront. Offer when specific topics come up. Dispatch individual agents. Write findings to `.ijfw/memory/research.md` after synthesis.
- At minimum, dispatch 1 scout agent to check the codebase for existing work.

**Both modes:** Mark completed when synthesis is shown (guided) or user is ready to move on (conversation).

## STEP 3: BRAINSTORM

### Visual Companion (UI/design tasks, offer BEFORE brainstorm starts)
If the project involves UI/design, offer via `AskUserQuestion` (or plain text if unavailable):
```json
{ "questions": [{ "question": "Some brainstorm decisions are easier to see visually. Want me to generate live HTML previews you can view in your browser as we go?", "header": "Visual", "multiSelect": false, "options": [
  { "label": "Yes, open visual preview (Recommended)", "description": "I'll generate HTML mockups for design decisions -- you'll see them in your browser" },
  { "label": "Text only", "description": "Keep everything in the terminal -- no browser needed" }
]}]}
```

**When visual companion is ON -- generate HTML mockups for SHAPE decisions:**
1. Write standalone HTML files to `.planning/brainstorm/` (one per option, Tailwind CDN, production-quality, real content)
2. Generate a `viewer.html` with tab navigation loading all options as iframes. See `references/think-phase.md` for template.
3. Open viewer in browser (platform-aware -- see PLATFORM section below)
4. Tell user: `Design viewer open -- click tabs to compare all options.`
5. THEN ask preference via `AskUserQuestion`
6. **You MUST generate HTML when visual is ON.** The user accepted visual previews -- deliver them.

### Guided mode -- 6 modules (Deep), 3 moves (Quick):

**Deep -- ALL mandatory:**
- **FRAME:** Problem, users, constraints, scope. `AskUserQuestion` one per turn. `FRAME done.`
- **RECON:** Present research synthesis. `AskUserQuestion`: which findings matter most. `RECON done.`
- **SHAPE:** 3-5 approaches via `AskUserQuestion`. If visual ON: generate HTML mockups FIRST. `SHAPE done.`
- **STRESS:** Pre-mortem. 4-5 failure scenarios, `AskUserQuestion` multiSelect for top 2 risks. `STRESS done.`
- **CONVERGE:** Success metrics + acceptance criteria. User confirms. `CONVERGE done.`
- **LOCK:** Paste brief in chat. User says `lock` / `fix <X>` / `go deeper`. On lock: Write `.ijfw/memory/brief.md`. Render as HTML and open in browser. `LOCK done.`

**Quick:** Frame -> Shape -> Lock.

### Conversation mode -- open brainstorm:

Continue the conversation as a creative collaborator.
- Periodic capture with checkpoint (see INTERACTION MODES above).
- Visual mockups at natural decision points for design tasks.
- **Lock:** When user is ready, synthesize conversation notes (`.planning/brainstorm/notes.md`) into a domain-appropriate brief using the templates below. Paste in chat. User says `lock`. Write `.ijfw/memory/brief.md`. Render as HTML and open.

### Brief format adapts to domain:
- **Software/technical:** Goal / audience / stack / architecture / acceptance criteria / constraints
- **Book/creative writing:** Premise / world rules / characters / tone / themes / scope / structure
- **Campaign/marketing:** Objective / audience / channels / messaging / success metrics
- **Design:** Problem / users / aesthetic / constraints / deliverables

### Second Opinion on brief (auto-fire if enabled):
Check if codex/gemini CLIs are available (`command -v codex gemini`). Fire only those that exist. If neither is installed, skip silently.
When clean: print `Second Opinion reviewed your brief -- all clear.` (one line, user sees the value).
When findings: `Second Opinion surfaced [N] points to consider. Address now?`

**GATE: Do NOT proceed until `.ijfw/memory/brief.md` exists.**

## STEP 4: BUILD TEAM (skip for Express)

Read brief. Pick domain template from `references/team-templates.md`. Present team with rationale.
Use `AskUserQuestion` for approval (or plain text if unavailable).
Mark completed after approval.

**GATE: Do NOT plan until team is approved.**

## STEP 5: PLAN + IMPLEMENTATION BREAKDOWN (see `references/build-phase.md`)

**Check:** `.ijfw/memory/brief.md` must exist. If not, go back to Step 3.

Two sub-steps:
1. **High-level plan with dependency analysis:** Execution strategy with tasks assigned to team. For each task, check: does it read/write files another task touches? Does it depend on another task's output? Organize into waves -- parallel (independent files/modules) or sequential (dependencies). Show the user WHY each wave is parallel or sequential. See `references/build-phase.md` for the dependency checklist.
2. **Implementation breakdown:** Each task broken into bite-sized steps (2-5 min each) with TDD where applicable and verifiable success criteria.

User approves the combined plan. Write `.ijfw/memory/plan.md`. Render as HTML and open in browser. Mark completed.

Second Opinion on plan: check CLI availability, fire if available. Print "all clear" or surface findings.

**GATE: Do NOT execute until plan is approved and `.ijfw/memory/plan.md` exists.**

## STEP 6: EXECUTE (see `references/build-phase.md`)

Offer execution mode: Sequential (< 5 tasks) or Subagent swarm (5+ tasks).

**Subagent swarm (parallel):** For each wave, send ALL Agent tool calls in a SINGLE response so they run concurrently. Do NOT dispatch one agent, wait for it, then dispatch the next -- that's sequential. Example: if Wave A has 3 tasks, your response contains 3 Agent tool calls at once. Use `run_in_background: true` on each.

**Sequential:** Execute tasks one at a time in the current session.

Both modes: `TaskCreate` per build task before dispatching. Two-stage review per task (spec + quality). Mark completed when all done.

## STEP 7: VERIFY (see `references/ship-phase.md`)

Run tests/lint/build -- evidence before claims. Verify against the **brief**, not just the plan.
Second Opinion on build (if enabled + available). Print "all clear" or findings.
Mark completed.

## STEP 8: SHIP (see `references/ship-phase.md`)

Use `AskUserQuestion` for ship options: PR / merge / deploy / keep branch.
Write `.ijfw/memory/handoff.md`. Mark completed.
Session receipt: `You went from [problem] to [shipped solution] in [time].`

## PLATFORM-AWARE BROWSER OPEN

Detect platform and use the right command:
```bash
# macOS
open <file>
# Linux
xdg-open <file>
# WSL
wslview <file> || cmd.exe /c start <file>
```
Use this pattern: `Bash("open <file> 2>/dev/null || xdg-open <file> 2>/dev/null || echo 'Open manually: <file>'")`
This works on macOS, Linux, and falls back to printing the path if neither works.

## RENDERING ARTIFACTS

When writing brief.md, plan.md, or research.md, also render as HTML and open in the browser. The user shouldn't have to open a file editor to read their own plan.

After writing any major .md file:
1. Generate an HTML file (same directory, .html extension) using marked.js CDN + github-markdown-dark CSS + DOMPurify for safe rendering
2. Open with the platform-aware command above
3. Tell user: `[Document name] open in your browser.`

See `references/think-phase.md` for the HTML rendering template.

---

## COMPACTION GATES (write state at every phase transition)

**Think -> Build:** Write `.ijfw/state/workflow-context.md` (phase, brief summary, key decisions, team roster, risks) and `.ijfw/state/workflow.json` (`{ "status": "in_progress", "phase": "build", ... }`).

**Build -> Ship:** Update both files with plan status, lessons captured, verification items.

**Ship complete:** Update both with `"status": "complete"`, shipped summary, handoff pointer.

These files enable resume after /clear or context compaction.

---

## INVARIANTS

- **Interaction style respected.** Guided = AskUserQuestion. Conversation = open dialogue with periodic capture + checkpoints.
- **Adaptive switching is natural.** No announcements. Read notes.md to avoid re-asking covered topics.
- **TaskCreate for every workflow step** (or text checklist if unavailable).
- **Brief before build.** `.ijfw/memory/brief.md` must exist before Step 5.
- **Research before brainstorm** (guided: upfront swarm; conversation: targeted when topics arise).
- **Team before plan.** Team approved before any planning.
- **Positive framing always.** "Second Opinion" not "cross-audit". "heads up" not "error". "ready to add" not "missing". Never use "violation" or "non-negotiable" in user-facing output.
- **Second Opinion is visible.** Always tell the user it ran, even when clean ("all clear").
- **Recommendations only with basis.** Fact questions get no recommendation. Judgment questions cite why.
- **Platform-aware.** Use the open fallback chain. Don't assume macOS.

## PRE-RESPONSE CHECKLIST

Before generating any response, verify:
- [ ] Am I in the right interaction mode? (guided: tool call first; conversation: just talk)
- [ ] Am I on the correct step? Check which tasks are completed.
- [ ] In conversation mode: have 3+ new substantive points emerged since last capture?
- [ ] In guided mode: am I asking ONE question, not dumping a list?
- [ ] Does `.ijfw/memory/brief.md` exist before I try to plan or build?
- [ ] Am I using positive framing? (no "violation", "non-negotiable", "error", "missing")
